sudo systemctl start mysql
```

### **4. Configure the Database**  
1. Open **phpMyAdmin** by visiting:  
   ```
   http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

```php
<?php
$host = "localhost"; 
$user = "root"; // Change if you have a MySQL password
$password = ""; // Set your password if applicable
$database = "crudphp";

$conn = new mysqli($host, $user, $password, $database);
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```
